## New South Wales Fuel Check

Fuel Check is a NSW Government supplied open dataset [1].

The following plot makes use of Plotly to present the data.  

The complete data set shows fuel prices for service stations in New South Wales in September.  

The plot shows data extracted for only one service station for simplicity.  

## Caltex Ballina Fuel prices September 2016    

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(lubridate)

setwd("C:\\Users\\Alan\\Desktop\\DSc-DataProducts\\wk3-ass\\")
fuelDS <- read.csv("Ballina-CTX-Fuel-September-2016.csv")
fuelDS$PriceUpdatedDate <- c(dmy_hm(fuelDS$PriceUpdatedDate[1:39]),dmy_hms(fuelDS$PriceUpdatedDate[40:91]))
attach(fuelDS)

plot_ly(fuelDS, x = PriceUpdatedDate, y = Price, color = FuelCode, type = "scatter") %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title = "Fuel Price in cents"))
```
   
## Notes

The data is a data frame with values for three different types of fuel, E10, P95 and PDL.
Where:  
* E10 is fuel containing 10% ethanol  
* P95 is premium grade 95  
* PDL is premium diesel  

Note also that there are multiple observations on the same day.  This makes the data appear by default as a scatter plot.  I would prefer to manipulate the data further in order to make a clean time series, but time is limited.

Note also that there is not much data for the PDL FuelCode.
