## A Tool to explore linear models

* Students can easily play with the data parameters
* App provides insight through immediate visualization
* Linear model and fit estimate (R-squared) feedback
* Intuitive understanding of linear model

## The model concept

A linear model based on some pseudo-random data, generated in R

```{r block_1, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

x <- runif(150, 0,500) 
y <- 20 + 1.25 * x + rnorm(150, 0, 50)
theModel <- lm(y ~ x, data = data.frame(y, x))
plot(x, y, xlab='x value', col='blue',main='The Model', xlim=c(-25,max(x)), ylim=c(-50,500))
abline(theModel, col="green",lwd=3)

```

## Generating linear data with some random error

Generating linear data.

      y = a + b * x + e

y - a linear transformation of the x data with some random error added   
a - is the intercept   
b - is the slope   
x - uniformly distributed random data   
e - is normally distributed with standard deviation set by the user.  

Note that student can change a, b, and e dynamically using sliders.

A linear model is fitted to the generated data and plotted over the generated points.
The R-squared value for the model is displayed to the user.
